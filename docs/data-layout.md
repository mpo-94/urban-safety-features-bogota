# What `data/` holds, and where

`data/` is not distributed with this repository and never will be: the crash
records and part of the cartography are not mine to redistribute. That makes this
file the only record of what the pipeline needs in order to run, and of where each
file has to sit for it to be found.

**It is written against `src/config.py` and has to stay that way.** Every path
below is built from a root declared at the top of that file, and the run reports
loudly when a declared file is not on disk. If the two ever disagree, the code is
right and this document is stale.

---

## The rule: one root per role

Data is filed by **the role it plays in the study**, not by its format and not by
the shape of the delivery it arrived in. The roles are the study's own vocabulary,
and each has a root declared in `config.py`:

| Root | Folder | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| `CARTOGRAPHY_DIR` | `data/geo/` | The territorial units and the two other divisions |
| `CASUALTIES_DIR` | `data/data_siniestros_bogota/` | The delivered crash records |
| `PREDICTORS_DIR` | `data/shp_properties_sorted/` | The urban layers the predictors are measured on |
| `EXPOSURE_DIR` | `data/shp_properties_sorted/` | The layers travel exposure is measured on |
| `POPULATION_DIR` | `data/population/` | The demographic file the denominators come from |
| `INCOMING_DIR` | `data/incoming/` | Deliveries not yet merged into the sources above |
| `INTEGRATED_DIR` | `data/integrated/` | What the `integrate` route rebuilds from a delivery |

**`PREDICTORS_DIR` and `EXPOSURE_DIR` point at the same folder today, and they are
still two roots.** The desire lines were delivered inside the bundle of predictor
layers, which is a fact about the delivery and not about the data: exposure is not
a predictor, it sits on the other side of a rate model, and a path that reached it
through the predictor root said the opposite of what the rest of the pipeline is
careful to say. Separating the declaration means the day the files move it is one
line of configuration. See D35 and D37.

**`data/integrated/` is the one place under `data/` that is not raw.** The
`integrate` route writes it and every other route reads it as an input, which is
why it is here and not under `results/`. Nothing else in `data/` is ever written
by the pipeline.

### Why `shp_properties_sorted/` is filed by geometry

Because the code dispatches on it: `GEOMETRY_FOLDERS` turns a layer's declared
geometry into the folder it is read from, so a layer declared as an area and
delivered as points fails at the path rather than being measured wrongly. That
scheme earns its keep here and nowhere else in `data/`.

It is not a check on the file's contents. Both `predictors.py` and `exposure.py`
compare the geometry types actually present against the declaration when they read
a layer, so the folder is a path segment and the verification happens elsewhere.

---

## The layers inside the predictor bundle

Thirteen variables are measured over eleven layers. The declaration in
`config.STATIC_PREDICTORS` is authoritative; this is the arrangement on disk.

| Folder | Geometry | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `areas/andenes_x_localidad` | area | sidewalk area share |
| `areas/avenidas_corregidas` | area | arterial road area share |
| `areas/calzada_x_localidad` | area | carriageway area share |
| `areas/parques_urb` | area | urban park area share |
| `areas/puentes` | area | bridge deck area share |
| `points/Paraderos_SITP` | point | SITP bus stop density |
| `points/Red_Semaforica` | point | signalised intersection density |
| `points/crossings` | point | pedestrian crossing density |
| `points/camaras_salvavidas_bogota` | point | speed camera density |
| `points/estacion_localidad` | point | TransMilenio station density |
| `points/arbolado_urbano` | point | the three tree variables |
| `lines/Líneas de deseo Matriz Origen Destino` | line | **exposure**, not a predictor |

### Delivered and not read

Four line layers carry an annual series and are **delivered and pending**, waiting
on the year rather than on a way of being measured:
`lines/ciclo_lines`, `lines/Señalizacion_Horizontal`,
`lines/Señalizacion_Horizontal_ZonasEscolares` and `points/Señalizacion_Vertical`.

Two more are **delivered and not declared**, and are recorded in
`config.UNDECLARED_PREDICTOR_LAYERS` so that a later session finds a reason rather
than an unexplained folder. The `predictors` route prints them on every run and
says whether each is still on disk.

| Folder | What it holds | Why it is not a variable |
|---|---|---|
| `areas/luminarias_upz` | street lighting by lamp technology | keyed on the 111 UPZ, which do not nest inside the 30 units |
| `areas/indiceseguridadnocturna` | a night-time safety perception index | perceived safety is closer to an outcome than to a cause |

Both were moved into `areas/` on 2026-09-05. The bundle had put `luminarias_upz`
beside the geometry folders as a layer among them, and `indiceseguridadnocturna`
under a folder called `mean`, which is not a geometry but the measurement the
delivery implied for it. That hint is kept in the configuration record, where it
can be read, rather than in a folder name that contradicts the scheme the code
dispatches on.

## Adding data

**Put a new delivery in `data/incoming/`, in a folder of its own, and leave the
existing sources alone.** A delivery that overwrites a folder in place keeps every
route running and silently changes the numbers they produce, which is the one
failure that leaves nothing out of place to notice. The files move out of
`incoming/` once they have been inspected and declared.

Then declare it. Nothing is read that is not declared:

- a predictor layer goes in `config.STATIC_PREDICTORS`;
- an exposure layer goes in `config.EXPOSURE_LAYERS` — the procedure is
  `docs/adding-an-exposure-layer.md`, and it starts with inspection because the
  first time round a column name lied;
- anything delivered and deliberately not read goes in
  `config.UNDECLARED_PREDICTOR_LAYERS` with the reason, so the folder is not a
  mystery later.

Update this file in the same commit as the move. `data/` is not in version
control, so nothing else can catch the two drifting apart.

## Known and provisional

**The mobility survey publications are in `incoming/` and unread.** They are the
four complete publications from the Alcaldía de Bogotá, placed on 2026-09-05,
replacing an earlier partial delivery. They are meant to replace the single
bicycle layer now used for exposure, and their shape is not the shape of what
they replace: they hold **survey trip records and the zoning those records are
keyed on, and no desire lines at all.**

The desire lines the pipeline reads today were derived from material of exactly
this kind — each line runs between two zone centroids and its records carry
`zat_origen` and `zat_destin` — so the geometry has to be built here rather than
declared. That is a stage of the pipeline that does not exist yet.

What each year holds for that purpose, out of everything published:

| Year | Household trip records | Zoning |
|---|---|---|
| 2011 | `120927_ConsultaEODH2011_DiaTipico (1).accdb`, 122 MB | **none delivered** |
| 2015 | `VIAJES_ANONIMIZADOS.csv`, 35 MB | `ZATs_2012_MAG.shp` |
| 2019 | `ViajesEODH2019.csv`, 23 MB | `ZONAS.zip`, holding UTAM and ZAT |
| 2023 | `05_Base datos procesada/CSV/d. Modulo viajes.csv`, 59 MB | two zips, `ZAT2023` and `UTAM2023` |

Everything else published alongside — the EMME model of 2011, the intercept
surveys, the reports, the forms, the indicator annexes — is out of scope and
stays where it is.

Five things are visible from the listing alone and are settled by inspection, not
in advance:

- **2011 carries no zoning of any kind.** No shapefile, no `.dbf`, nothing named
  for a zone. Trips keyed on ZAT codes cannot become centroids without it. The
  2015 folder carries `ZATs_2012_MAG`, which is plausibly the zoning the 2011
  survey used, but that has to be shown against the codes and not assumed.
- **2011 is an Access database**, where every other year is CSV. The 64-bit Access
  ODBC driver is installed on this machine and the environment's Python is 64-bit,
  so it is readable, but only with a dependency the project does not have yet.
- **The zoning is a different set of zones each year.** Per-year apportionment to
  the units is unaffected; reading one zone across years is not the same zone.
- **Each year publishes the same records twice**, as CSV and as XLSX, and 2023
  publishes both a raw and a processed database. Which one is read has to be
  declared rather than picked at the moment of reading.
- **Walking has to be confirmed for every year.** The four modes the study wants
  are on foot, bicycle, motorcycle and car, and the trip records are the only
  place all four could be.

Where the files will finally live follows from all of that. Until then
`EXPOSURE_DIR` still points into the predictor bundle.

**The current desire-lines layer is quoted in finished work** — D35, section 13 of
the verification report, and `deliverables/plan.md` all carry figures measured on
it. It must not be overwritten in place when the replacement is declared; the
superseded delivery has to remain reachable or those figures stop being
reproducible.

**Eight `.DS_Store` files** are scattered through the delivered folders. They are
Finder artefacts from the machine the data was prepared on, they are read by
nothing, and they are left where they are because they came with the delivery.
